# Project-Exploring-London-s-Travel-Network

This project explores public transport usage trends in London using journey volume data provided by **Transport for London (TfL)**. The data includes monthly figures for various modes of transport—such as the London Underground, buses, trams, DLR, and more—from across Greater London.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a slightly modified version of official TfL data made available by the Mayor of London’s office. You can find the original data at [data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset).


## Note
This project was completed as part of a DataCamp SQL project titled **"Analyzing Public Transport Journeys in London."** All analysis is done for educational and portfolio purposes.
